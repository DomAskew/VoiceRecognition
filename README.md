# VoiceRecognition
Voice Recognition Project - Using Spectral analysis and Fourier Transforms to correctly match voices to saved .wav files.

In this project, i utilized MATLAB and my understanding of Fourier transforms on images.. translating this to wave format data to analyse wave spectrum patterns to compare voice notes to saved speaker files.

Note - To run the code, download all files into the same folder and run PRACTICE.m. Now you need audiofiles of several speakers and take 5 repeats of them saying a word. The example used here is 'Zero'. Now save these in the format '1s1' for example. where the first number declares the speaker, and the final number declares the repeat number.

Report will be attached soon - just waiting for access to it from the university.
