# VoiceRecognition
Voice Recognition Project - Using Spectral analysis and Fourier Transforms to correctly match voices to saved .wav files.

In this project, i utilized MATLAB and my understanding of Fourier transforms on images.. translating this to wave format data to analyse wave spectrum patterns to compare voice notes to saved speaker files.
